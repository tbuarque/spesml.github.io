# Maturity Model for MBSE Introduction

In this page we describe the SpesML Maturity Model (SpesML MM) which goal is to help teams to adopt the SpesML methodology. This is achived, first, by mapping their current Model-based Systems Engineering (MBSE) processes using the SpesML MM. These must be adapted to the SpesML methodology. And second, by finding out which capabilities should be implemented anew to reach the desired maturity level. The SpesML MM was devepeloped based on the Model-based Systems Engineering Maturity Model developed in the context of the SPEDIT project.
